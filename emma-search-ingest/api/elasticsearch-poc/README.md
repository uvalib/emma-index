## Elasticsearch Proof of Concept

This contains an AWS Lambda function which is not part of the production project.  
It was used to prove that we can get this project to work with Elasticsearch.  
The passthrough functionality lets you pass through Elasticsearch calls so you can try them out in the context of the API Gateway + Lambda environment.

If this doesn't serve as a useful tool anymore, you can delete this directory.
